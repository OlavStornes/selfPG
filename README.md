SelfPG - a zero-player game set in a Turn based RPG-enviroment
======
## Startup
SelfPG can in the current state be started from __gui.py__.

## Disclaimer
1. What SelfPG isn't
    * A playable game in a traditional sense
    * A high end simulation
2. What SelfPG attempts to be:
    * A personal project to deepens the knowledge on python and self-taught introduction of GUI-development



Note: A lot of the implementation is currently in early early access. There will be unpolished code, unbalanced parties and partly unintuitive logic.
